                    <p>I learned gaming industry dynamics while analyzing 35+ years of sales data—watching the industry evolution from arcade machines to mobile gaming play out in the numbers.</p>
                    
                    <p>The challenge was identifying which games would succeed in 2017 based on historical trends. I analyzed sales across platforms (Xbox, PlayStation, PC), regions (North America, Europe, Japan), and genres to determine the factors that actually drive success.</p>
                    
                    <p>The most valuable outcome was translating statistical findings into clear business recommendations. I created visualizations that show exactly where to allocate advertising spend—accessible to marketing teams without requiring technical expertise.</p>
                    
                    <p>This was my first forecasting project using Python. I leveraged GitHub Copilot to accelerate the learning process, which taught me how to work effectively with AI development tools—an increasingly essential skill in technical roles.</p>

                    <p>I learned statistical hypothesis testing for this project—understanding concepts like p-values and confidence intervals. Through focused research and working with Copilot, I grasped not just the calculations, but the practical interpretation and application of these methods.</p>
                    
                    <p>The project analyzed a telecom company's calling plan performance. I researched how telecom businesses operate, then worked through 5 datasets to understand how customers actually use their minutes, texts, and data.</p>
                    
                    <p>The objective was straightforward: provide executives with a data-driven recommendation on which calling plan to promote. All the statistical analysis ultimately served one clear, actionable decision—exactly the kind of work that bridges technical analysis and business value.</p>
                    
                    <p>I designed the analysis to be reproducible with updated data, not just a one-time deliverable. This distinction separates academic exercises from production-ready business solutions.</p>

                <div class="project-item-content">
                    <p>This was my first experience working with large-scale data—approximately 30 million grocery transactions from Instacart. The scale was challenging initially, but I learned to systematically break it down and identify meaningful patterns in customer shopping behavior.</p>
                    
                    <p>I connected 5 different datasets to understand the full customer journey. Key questions included: When do customers typically order? What products do they purchase together? Which items do they reorder? I'd develop hypotheses, then validate them through data exploration.</p>
                    
                    <p>The deliverable was a Jupyter notebook that walks through the complete analytical story—from raw transaction data to business insights. I designed it for product managers to understand immediately what customers are doing and why it matters for decision-making.</p>
                    
                    <p>Working with real-world data meant handling missing values, inconsistent formats, and unexpected anomalies. Learning to clean and manage messy data professionally was as valuable as any specific insight from the analysis.</p>

                <div class="project-item-content">
                    <p>This foundation project focused on learning pandas fundamentals through hands-on practice with real streaming platform data. I worked through filtering, sorting, and grouping operations—building the core skills needed for any data analysis work. The learning approach emphasized practical application over theory.</p>
                    
                    <p>The dataset had significant quality issues from the start: missing values, inconsistent date formats, duplicate entries. I developed systematic cleaning processes rather than ad-hoc fixes, and created reusable functions for common operations—thinking like an engineer building maintainable solutions.</p>
                    
                    <p>These pandas skills became foundational for every subsequent project. Once you can confidently manipulate data structures, you can work with any domain—customer records, sales transactions, web analytics, or operational logs.</p>
                    
                    <p>The analysis itself provided insights for streaming content acquisition decisions. This reinforced an important principle: technical tools exist to serve business outcomes, not the reverse. The technology enables the analysis, but the business question drives the work.</p>
