                    <p>I analyzed 35+ years of gaming industry sales data to forecast which products would succeed in 2017. This required understanding the industry's evolution from arcade machines to mobile gaming—context that turns raw numbers into strategic insights.</p>
                    
                    <p>The challenge was identifying success factors across platforms (Xbox, PlayStation, PC), regions (North America, Europe, Japan), and genres. I built statistical models using historical trends to pinpoint exactly what drives sales in this multi-billion dollar market.</p>
                    
                    <p>I translated complex statistical findings into clear business recommendations. The visualizations I created show exactly where to allocate advertising spend—designed for marketing teams to understand immediately without needing technical backgrounds.</p>
                    
                    <p>I worked with GitHub Copilot throughout this project, using AI development tools to accelerate delivery. This approach reflects how modern technical professionals work—leveraging technology to solve problems faster and better.</p>

                <div class="project-item-content">
                    <p>I applied statistical hypothesis testing to analyze a telecom company's calling plan performance. This required understanding p-values, confidence intervals, and—more importantly—how to interpret these metrics for business decisions rather than just running calculations.</p>
                    
                    <p>I researched how telecom businesses operate, then analyzed 5 datasets to understand customer behavior with minutes, texts, and data. This groundwork was essential—you can't provide valuable recommendations without understanding the business context behind the numbers.</p>
                    
                    <p>The objective was straightforward: provide executives with a data-driven recommendation on which calling plan to promote. All the statistical analysis served one clear, actionable decision—exactly the kind of work that bridges technical analysis and business value.</p>
                    
                    <p>I designed the analysis to be reproducible with updated data, not just a one-time deliverable. This distinction separates throwaway reports from production-ready business solutions that organizations can actually rely on.</p>

                <div class="project-item-content">
                    <p>I analyzed approximately 30 million grocery transactions from Instacart to uncover customer shopping behavior patterns. Working at this scale requires systematic approaches—you can't just look at the data and spot trends. You need frameworks to break it down and extract meaningful insights.</p>
                    
                    <p>I connected 5 different datasets to understand the full customer journey. Key questions: When do customers order? What products do they purchase together? Which items do they reorder? I developed hypotheses, then validated them through data exploration—the scientific method applied to business analytics.</p>
                    
                    <p>The deliverable was a Jupyter notebook that walks through the complete analytical story—from raw transaction data to business insights. I designed it for product managers to understand immediately what customers are doing and why it matters for their decisions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Real-world data always comes with missing values, inconsistent formats, and unexpected anomalies. I handled these systematically rather than treating them as obstacles—data quality work is part of delivering reliable insights that stakeholders can trust.</p>

                    <p>I analyzed streaming platform data to build insights for content acquisition decisions. The technical work involved pandas operations—filtering, sorting, grouping—but the real value was translating viewer behavior into actionable recommendations for what content to acquire.</p>
                    
                    <p>The dataset had significant quality issues from the start: missing values, inconsistent date formats, duplicate entries. I developed systematic cleaning processes rather than ad-hoc fixes, and created reusable functions for common operations. This engineering mindset ensures solutions that scale beyond one-off analyses.</p>
                    
                    <p>The data manipulation skills from this project transfer directly to any domain—customer records, sales transactions, web analytics, operational logs. Once you can confidently work with data structures, you can provide value across industries.</p>
                    
                    <p>This project reinforced an important principle: technical tools exist to serve business outcomes, not the reverse. The technology enables the analysis, but the business question drives the work. That perspective separates analysts who deliver value from those who just run code.</p>
